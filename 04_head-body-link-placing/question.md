## What is the difference between Head and Body ?

- `head` tag tells about meta information 
- its the information about the document
- `head` tag contains meta, title, script, and link tags
- `body` tag generally contains the page content


## Where will you place the scrips ?

- if `dom` is not manipulated, keep scripts inside `head` tag 
- otherwise keep the scripts at the end of `body` tag so that the manipulations will be done early
