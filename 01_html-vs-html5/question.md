## Describe major difference between HTML and HTML5 ?


1. **Doctype Declaration**:
    - HTML: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`
    - HTML5: `<!DOCTYPE html>` (simplified declaration).

2. **New Semantic Elements**:
    - HTML5 introduces semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>` for better content structure.

3. **Multimedia Support**:
    - HTML5 provides native support for audio (`<audio>`) and video (`<video>`) elements without requiring plugins.

4. **Canvas and SVG**:
    - HTML5 includes the `<canvas>` element and supports `Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)` for drawing graphics directly in the browser.

5. **Form Enhancements**:
    - New input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, `range`, and `search` are introduced in HTML5.
    - Attributes like `placeholder`, `required`, and `autofocus` improve form usability.

6. **Offline Storage**:
    - HTML5 introduces Web Storage APIs (`localStorage` and `sessionStorage`) for client-side data storage.

7. **Geolocation API**:
    - HTML5 includes a Geolocation API to retrieve the user's location.

8. **Deprecated Elements**:
    - Elements like `<font>`, `<center>`, and `<big>` are deprecated in HTML5 in favor of CSS.

9. **Improved Accessibility**:
    - HTML5 provides ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes for better accessibility.

10. **Performance Improvements**:
     - HTML5 is designed to work seamlessly with modern web technologies, improving performance and reducing reliance on external plugins.
