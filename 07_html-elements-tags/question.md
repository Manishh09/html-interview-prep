## What are HTML ELements ?  and What is the difference between Element and a Tag ?

- HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. They define the structure and content of the document. An HTML element typically consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

The difference between an element and a tag is as follows:
- A **tag** is a part of the syntax used to define an element. For example, `<p>` is a tag.
- An **element** includes the `start tag`, `the content`, and `the end tag` (if applicable). For example, `<p>Hello, World!</p>` is an element.

In short, tags are components of elements, while elements represent the complete structure.
